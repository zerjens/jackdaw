  "A test-machine executes sequences of test commands

   Test machines can be constructed to operate against a variety of targets. For
   example:

     - a local development kafka cluster
     - a mock topology processor
     - a cluster shared with other users

   In each of these cases, as a test-author we typically want to do the same type
   of thing. Inject a bunch of events into the system, wait until the system under
   test has finished processing, see what comes out the other end, and check that
   looks good.

   But the mechanism by which data is injected and observed is different in each
   case. The test-machine exists so that the author doesn't care. The exact same
   test (or scenario) can be executed against a mock topology processor, a kafka
   cluster running on localhost, or (via smokin or the rest-proxy) a remote
   kafka cluster shared with other users."

;;   :exit-hooks  ;; []
;;   :consumer    {:messages (s/stream)} source of test output
;;   :producer    {:messages (s/stream)} sink for test-input

;; The consumer and producer keys are themselves maps that each contains a
;; `:messages` channel used for kafka IO. `(get-in machine [:producer :messages])`
;; is a channel into which the test-machine feeds test-input from the scenario and
;; `(get-in machine [:consumer :messages])` is a channel into which topic data is
;; read from kafka.

;; The `journaller` is used to asynchronously read topics of interest and log
;; their output in a `:journal` key. Test middlware may use the journal to obtain a
;; snapshot of the test input/output during the execution of a command. See the
;; middleware and the `watch` command for example usage
;; of this feature.

;; The `:exit-hooks` key may be used by middleware that requires the disposal of any
;; resources when the test machine is closed.
